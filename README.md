#Ola Data Analytics — End-to-End Project

A beginner-friendly, full-stack analytics project tracking ride-hailing data using SQL, MySQL Server, and Power BI.

🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates the workflow of a data analyst by taking raw Ola ride data, cleaning and analyzing it in MySQL Server, and visualizing insights through interactive dashboards in Power BI.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
	•	SQL — Data querying, transformation, and analysis
	•	MySQL Server — Database for storing and processing cleaned data
	•	Power BI — Data visualization and KPI reporting

📊 Key KPIs & Insights
	•	Total Rides — Count of completed trips
	•	Total Revenue — Sum of fares from completed rides
	•	Average Fare — Revenue per ride
	•	Cancellation Rate — % of rides cancelled by driver or passenger
	•	On-Time Pickup Rate — % of rides starting on schedule
	•	City-wise & Zone-wise Performance — Ride demand, supply, and revenue

	•	What are the peak booking times?
	•	Which payment methods are most used?
	•	How do cancellation reasons vary by location?
	•	What’s the trend in revenue and ride count over time?

📜 Workflow
	1.	Data Cleaning — Remove duplicates, handle missing values, normalize formats.
	2.	SQL Analysis in MySQL Server — Create tables, run aggregation queries, generate summary views.
	3.	Visualization in Power BI — Connect to MySQL, import summary tables, design dashboards, and create DAX measures for KPIs.
	4.	Documentation — Export dashboard screenshots, maintain metric definitions in /docs.

⚡ How to Run
	1.	Import raw data into MySQL Server.
	2.	Run SQL scripts in /sql/ to create schema, clean data, and prepare analysis tables/views.
	3.	Open Power BI and connect to your MySQL database.
	4.	Refresh the dashboard visuals and interact with the reports.
